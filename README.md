Excited to share my latest project in the Hospitality domain!

I recently worked on a Revenue Insights project for AtliQ Grands, a hotel business that was facing a drop in revenue and market share.

Using Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for dashboard creation, I analyzed 3 months of revenue data to uncover the root causes.
The dashboard helped the Revenue Team identify performance gaps and trendsâ€”supporting decisions that could lead to a 20% recovery in revenue in just one month.

This project helped me sharpen my skills in Power BI, Excel, and data storytelling, and showed me how data can drive real business growth.
